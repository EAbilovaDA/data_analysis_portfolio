## Study Project
This section showcases the courses and training programs that build the foundation of my data analysis skills, along with GitHub repositories containing code and Jupyter notebooks created during my learning and independent exploration of data and programming.


### Yandex Practicum Data Analyst Program

**🎓 Repo:** [yandex_data_analyst_course](https://github.com/EAbilovaDA/yandex_data_analyst_course)

**Description:**  This is a 7-month professional training program at [Practicum by Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.ru/data-analyst/), focused on developing practical data analysis skills.
The curriculum covered Python programming, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL, Statistics, business metrics analysis, A/B testing, data visualization, and Tableau.

Over the course, I completed 8 full-scale educational projects, each simulating real-world analytical tasks — from cleaning and exploring large datasets to hypothesis testing, business decision-making, and data storytelling.

**Status:** Completed in October 2024.
**Certificate:**



## Portfolio Projects
A collection of my Data Analytics projects demonstrating my skills and progress over time.


### Kazakhstan Auto Market Analysis

**🚗 Repo:** [Kazakhstan Auto Market Analysis](https://github.com/EAbilovaDA/Kazakhstan_Auto_Market_Analysis)  
          
**Description:** The goal was to analyze car sales in Kazakhstan for 2019, evaluate the market position of the dealership “Merkur Auto”, identify reasons for revenue decline, and suggest potential opportunities for sales growth.  
**Skills:** Data cleaning, handling missing and inconsistent data, detecting duplicates, data enrichment, standardization of formats and types , exploratory data analysis, data aggregation with pivot tables, revenue analysis, market segmentation, competitive analysis, BCG analisis, data visualization, hypothesis testing, Pearson correlation calculation.  

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Seaborn, Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.  
**Results:** Cleaned, structured, and enriched dataset ready for market analysis, market and dealership analysis of “Mercur Auto”, identification of causes of revenue decline, dealership profile definition, Competitor Scorecard, and BCG analysis of models with recommendations for prioritizing sales growth.


### Traffic Accident Analysis in Saint Petersburg

**🚦 Repo:** [Traffic Accident Analysis](https://github.com/EAbilovaDA/traffic_accident_analysis)  
  
**Description:** This analysis was done for a non-profit project called **“Karta DTП”** ([dtp-stat.ru](http://dtp-stat.ru/)), which works with open data about road safety in Russia.

The project’s objectives were to study the trends in traffic accidents over the available period, identify key patterns and risk factors affecting the severity and frequency of collisions, and test hypotheses to statistically validate the observed trends.

**Skills:** **Web scraping** and automated file download, loading and normalizing **GeoJSON data**, **creating separate tables** for accidents, participants, and vehicles, exporting cleaned DataFrames to **SQLite database**, exploratory data analysis with **Data_Profiling**, data cleaning and transformation, data type conversion and feature engineering, anomaly handling, analyzing data relationships with **SQL queries**, data visualization, hypothesis testing with **Chi-square test**.

**Tools:** Python, SQLite3, JSON, Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Requests, Zipfile,  OS, BeautifulSoup, ydata_profiling, Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.

**Results:** Cleaned and structured datasets stored in SQLite, performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis with profiling, identified key accident factor relationships, visualized insights clearly, conducted Chi-square hypothesis testing, and established a reliable data foundation for traffic safety research.
